Keep in Med has been thought and developed by Giamir Buoncristiani as personal project to pass the Web Programming exam of Computer Engineering faculty at Universit√† di Pisa.

Unfortunately all the documentation is only in Italian for now (I'm counting to translate that as soon as I can).

You can visit the project website here: _[giamir.com/keepinmed](http://giamir.com/keepinmed)_

You can try a demo at this address: _[giamir.com/keepinmed/demo](http://giamir.com/keepinmed/demo)_<br>
